# AIM:
To study the problem statement ,SRS document and draw the UML diagram of student enrollment system .



# SRS (Procedure):
Create the following diagrams in StarUML:

Use Case Diagram

Class Diagram

Activity Diagram

Package Diagram

Communication Diagram

Sequence Diagram

1 . Students create an account and log in to the system.

2 . Their data is verified and approved by the admin before generating a student ID.

3 . Students register for courses, and the system updates course details and study materials.

4 . The system monitors fee payments and allows students to write tests.

5 . Grades are generated automatically after evaluation.

6 . Reports are created and stored securely in the database for future reference.
